I have been on the service fabric team for a couple years now, with a primary focus on improving supportability. Supportability can mean a lot of things so lets narrow it down to the scope of a platform for developers/administrators. While there are more groups who use this product, the examples ahead will be easier to identify what makes them more effective if using this lens. While there are configurations which can be more involved for the purpose of this article, Service Fabric will be referred to as a platform.

## What is the Goal?

The goal is to reduce the effort required to maintain and increase insights into using a Service Fabric cluster by achieving the following goals, in order of increasing impact. 

### Platform expectations
We will talk about the following expectations for platform to user interactions.

* A platform ability to inform users when there is an issue 
* A platform ability to differentiate when it's a "platform" issue or a "user" issue
* A platform ability to thoroughly explain an issue and how to resolve it

The ideal goal is complete self mitigation where the platforms user can confidently diagnose and resolve their issue but in a platform as complex as service fabric this can be extremely difficult to do, so the next best thing is to get as many low hanging fruit issues as possible. 

## Informing users when there is an issue
This might sound like an obvious statement but in reality it becomes more of a question of determining how much viability a given issue needs. 

* Is it transient where maybe it's due to a spike in usage?
* Does this problem if unchecked destroy a cluster? 
* Could something while not be a problem now, become one if something else happens at the same time?

When the objective gets reframed around identifying the most critical issues at a given time it becomes more interesting. Taking service fabric as an example, let's say out of nowhere we notice our service has had an availability hit.

consistency is key. One of the more recent goals was to make each page consistent by following the same layout for each one. This avoids searching for key information in each page.
